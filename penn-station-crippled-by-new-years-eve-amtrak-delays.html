It had already been delayed an hour, and they weren’t buying the new schedule time.</p><p>“A train just boarded that was scheduled for 6:00 a.m. We found a guy from Amtrak and said, ‘There’s no way this train leaves in ten minutes, right?’ He just shook his head and walked away.

When we showed up we didn’t see the train on the board, had no idea what was going on. Airlines are shitty, but at least when you’re at the airport, the airline is telling you everything.”</p><p>“You’d think a government-funded rail program would run better…actually, now that I say that out loud, maybe not.”</p><p>The delays came as one million people were expected in <a href=#>Times Square for the ball drop</a> — all of them encouraged to leave their cars at home and rely on mass transit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmbGlforK1vs5op56mnmLAta3ToqanZZOntrG8y56bZpqpYrumw4yynJqqo2Kyt7GMmqStqpGgeqWxy5qwrGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpenn-station-crippled-by-new-years-eve-amtrak-delays.html&text=Penn%20Station%20crippled%20by%20New%20Year%27s%20Eve%20Amtrak%20delays&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpenn-station-crippled-by-new-years-eve-amtrak-delays.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpenn-station-crippled-by-new-years-eve-amtrak-delays.html&title=Penn%20Station%20crippled%20by%20New%20Year%27s%20Eve%20Amtrak%20delays" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpenn-station-crippled-by-new-years-eve-amtrak-delays.html&title=Penn%20Station%20crippled%20by%20New%20Year%27s%20Eve%20Amtrak%20delays" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpenn-station-crippled-by-new-years-eve-amtrak-delays.html&title=Penn%20Station%20crippled%20by%20New%20Year%27s%20Eve%20Amtrak%20delays" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpenn-station-crippled-by-new-years-eve-amtrak-delays.html&description=Penn%20Station%20crippled%20by%20New%20Year%27s%20Eve%20Amtrak%20delays" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-weston-peick-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-rumours-and-facts-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Weston Peick Dating Now?
