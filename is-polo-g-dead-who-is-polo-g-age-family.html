Age, Family, And More – Polo G is an American rapper who rose to prominence with his singles “Finer Things” and “Pop Out”. “Pop Out” became Polo G’s highest-charting song worldwide, peaking at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100.</strong></p><p>Polo G’s Polo is named after Polo Ralph Lauren or the Ralph Lauren company. And the G in the Polo G is named after his late best friend, nicknamed Gucci. He also compared himself to Tupac, who makes the same type of music, further saying so in an Instagram post ahead of RAPSTAR’s music video.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Polo G Dead?</h2><p>No, rapper Polo G is safe and alive and the rumors circulating on social media about Polo G’s death are baseless and false. In 2019, he was hospitalized for a drug overdose at a party and has since quit Ecstasy and Xanax following the aforementioned hospitalization and the death of fellow rapper and friend Juice WRLD.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Polo G?</h2><p>Taurus Tremani Bartlett born on January 6, 1999, known professionally as Polo G, is an American rapper who rose to fame with his singles “Finer Things” and “Pop Out” (featuring Lil Tjay). His debut album Die a Legend (2019) peaked at number six on the US Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the RIAA.</p><p>Polo G’s second studio album, The Goat (2020), peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and charted 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. His mainstream success continued with his third studio album Hall of Fame (2021), which became his first chart-topping album and included his first number-one single “Rapstar”.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Polo G grew up in Marshall Field Garden Apartments in the Old Town neighborhood of north Chicago, Illinois to Taurus Bartlett and Stacia Mac. Stacia Mac, a former estate agent, is Polo G’s manager. He is the second of four children, with an older sister, a younger brother, Taurean, who is also a rapper under the stage name Trench Baby, and a younger sister.</p><p>After high school, Polo G was accepted to Lincoln College with a Broadcasting major, but dropped out on the first day, choosing instead to pursue a full-time music career. He is part of the Chicago-based gang “Vice Rose”, known for teaming up with gangsters such as the Gangster Disciples.</p><p>Polo G’s first song ever recorded was titled “ODA”, which he released to YouTube. Upon creating a SoundCloud account in 2018, he released the track “Gang with Me”, which quickly racked up millions of plays. He continued gaining traction with his songs “Welcome Back” and “Neva Cared”.</p><p>Polo G went on to release “Finer Things”, a song he wrote while incarcerated, in the latter half of 2018 and quickly gained millions of views. In early 2019, he released “Pop Out” featuring Lil Tjay which peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song’s music video gained over 200 million views on YouTube and led to him signing a record deal with Columbia Records.</p><p>Polo G also released videos for his songs “Deep Wounds”, “Through da Storm”, “Effortless”, and “Dyin’ Breed” from his debut studio album Die a Legend, which was released on June 7, 2019, and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard 200. “Heartless”, a single released later in 2019, featured production from Mustard and was later featured on his second album.</p><p>Polo G was initially known for its Chicago drill sound but eventually switched to a more melodic style. He is known for his “vivid and explicit storytelling”. His lyrics often deal with difficult issues such as racism and mental health. He cites American rappers Lil Wayne and Tupac Shakur as his biggest influences. He also grew up with Gucci Mane, Chicago rapper Lil Durk, and G. Harbo.</p><p>On June 11, 2021, Polo G and his 16-year-old brother were arrested by officers from the Miami Police Department leaving his album release party and charged with 2 Felonies: Battery of an officer and Threatening a public servant, and 3 misdemeanors: Criminal mischief, Resisting arrest, Resisting an officer without violence.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>According to police, the vehicle was stopped due to having “dark tinted windows”. Polo G initially refused to exit the vehicle and called his mother on Facetime. According to USA Today, in the arrest report, officers stated that they ordered everyone to exit the vehicle to be searched for firearms after a passenger stated that the vehicle was bulletproof. Police stated that Polo G struggled with the officer attempting to handcuff him, sticking him.</p><p>On November 15, 2021, police dropped the two felony charges and the misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief citing insufficient evidence. Prosecutors agreed to drop the remaining charges if Polo G attended an anger management program. It was reported on April 9, 2022, that he did not plead guilty to any wrongdoing but did complete the program and the remaining charges were dropped.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Polo G Real Name?</h2><p>Polo G’s real name is Taurus Tremani Bartlett.
