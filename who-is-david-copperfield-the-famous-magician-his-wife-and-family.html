During this period, he notably taught a course in magic at New York University before enrolling at Fordham University, although he did not spend only about three weeks before packing up and moving to Chicago to take on the lead role.&nbsp;in the musical&nbsp;</span><span>The Magic Man</span><span>.&nbsp;It was around this time that Copperfield took on his current stage name, when he began starring in magic shows across the country, while performing in the musical, which became the longest-running in history. Chicago history.</span></p><p><span>In 1977, David Copperfield managed to present his first television show called The Magic of ABC, which exposed him to a wider audience.&nbsp;The following year he appeared in a CBS special called&nbsp;</span><span>The Magic of David Copperfield</span><span>&nbsp;after which he appeared in the film&nbsp;</span><span>Terror Train</span><span>&nbsp;(1980).&nbsp;Between 1978 and 2001, Copperfield made a total of 19 television specials and documentaries, including his most famous illusions such as the disappearance of an airplane, the disappearance and reappearance of the Statue of Liberty, him floating above the Grand Canyon, walking through the Great Wall of China, then escaping Alcatraz prison.</span></p><p><span>In the early 2000s, David Copperfield was performing more than 500 shows a year in different countries around the world.&nbsp;According to Forbes, the magician was earning millions of dollars at that time estimated to be around $55 million, placing him among the top ten biggest celebrity earners.&nbsp;As of 2018, all of this income put his net worth at $1 billion, making him the most commercially successful magician in history.</span></p><h2><strong><span>David Copperfield Family – wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>David Copperfield is unmarried but married to French model and designer, Chloé Gosselin.&nbsp;The pair reportedly started dating as far back as 2006, but chose to keep it a secret.&nbsp;In February 2010, they certified their relationship somewhat by welcoming a daughter, Sky, before getting engaged a few years later.&nbsp;It’s unclear if and when the two will get married, as Copperfield has previously opened up about her fear of getting married.&nbsp;This doesn’t seem to bother his future wife, as she said in an interview.&nbsp;The magician and she share a deep friendship as well as a child.&nbsp;It’s the most important commitment they could have with each other without getting married.</span></p><p><span>Gosselin born August 22, 1984 in Dreux, France now lives with his partner and daughter in the United States.&nbsp;She divides her time between their home in Las Vegas and New York and the Caribbean islands of Copperfield, known as Copperfield Bay.&nbsp;She is very active on social media through which she promotes the shoes she designs.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMnZivoZRisLC8z56pn6GVobFuwMeeZJ%2BZnaTCtHnMmp6im5mWu260yKxksKGWmnqiusNmnZqlmaHGcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-david-copperfield-the-famous-magician-his-wife-and-family.html&text=Who%20is%20David%20Copperfield%2c%20the%20famous%20magician%3fHis%20wife%20and%20family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-david-copperfield-the-famous-magician-his-wife-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-david-copperfield-the-famous-magician-his-wife-and-family.html&title=Who%20is%20David%20Copperfield%2c%20the%20famous%20magician%3fHis%20wife%20and%20family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-david-copperfield-the-famous-magician-his-wife-and-family.html&title=Who%20is%20David%20Copperfield%2c%20the%20famous%20magician%3fHis%20wife%20and%20family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-david-copperfield-the-famous-magician-his-wife-and-family.html&title=Who%20is%20David%20Copperfield%2c%20the%20famous%20magician%3fHis%20wife%20and%20family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-david-copperfield-the-famous-magician-his-wife-and-family.html&description=Who%20is%20David%20Copperfield%2c%20the%20famous%20magician%3fHis%20wife%20and%20family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./best-hair-wavers-for-mermaid-waves.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="7 best hair wavers to perfect the trending mermaid waves">&larr;
