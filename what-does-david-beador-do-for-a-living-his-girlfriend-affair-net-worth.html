With determination and hard work, the Beadors achieved enviable success and propelled the Californian company to massive heights.</span></p><p><span>The company is primarily in residential as well as non-residential works, such as the construction of streets, highways and bridges.&nbsp;Reports say that they record sales amounting to $50-100 million per year from which they make a total revenue of between $10-25 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>The reality star has an estimated net worth of a whopping $20 million, and much of that estimated amount is credited to her commercial relays.&nbsp;He also won from his appearance in reality TV.&nbsp;In 2011, the business mogul acquired the Newport Beach home for $2.35 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Personal life – wife, girlfriend, affair</span></strong></h2><p><span>Along with being a renowned business mogul, Beador was also given the spotlight as the husband of Real Housewives of Orange County’s Shannon Beador.&nbsp;David and Shannon were married in December 2000 in a private wedding ceremony with family and friends in attendance.</span></p><p><span>Together they had three daughters;&nbsp;their first daughter, Sophia and twins Stella and Adeline.&nbsp;However, things have gradually gone downhill between the once happy couple over the years.&nbsp;In December 2017, after announcing their divorce, David and Shannon separated after concluding the process.&nbsp;As a result of the agreement, Shannon was to receive alimony of $12,000 per month for child support and also $18,000 per month for spousal support.</span></p><p><span>David Beador left with his new girlfriend Lesley Cook, a DIY blogger.&nbsp;Just three months after his divorce from his ex-wife, David went public with Cook on Valentine’s Day 2018. This was after he was seen publicly with the blogger in January 2018. For the businessman, he doesn’t was just moving on, but for the general public, it wasn’t just about moving on, but the fact that he did it rather too soon and too quickly..&nbsp;It raised a lot of eyebrows and many speculated that Baedor was having an affair with Lesley Cook while still married to Shannon.</span></p><p><span>The businessman greeted his fans with liked photos of him with Shannon on Instagram and also wished her a happy Valentine’s Day on February 14, 2018. Cook was quick to respond in the most soothing way noting how her life had become brighter since meeting her.&nbsp;While this got fans excited, some others were unhappy with the syndicate.</span></p><p><span>Shortly after the two brought their love to the public eye, David’s ex-wife, Shannon, gave her version of the circumstances surrounding their divorce.&nbsp;She revealed it on “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” in July 2018. She hinted that Cook was the reason for their divorce.&nbsp;According to Shannon, her daughters had met Cook during the divorce process.&nbsp;The new couple are said to have met in a SoulCycle class, but the only thing that’s unclear is when they met.</span></p><p><span>However, according to reports, the couple had already separated in October 2017 before David and Lesley were seen together.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmJbBbrDOnqpmnJGrtqV5wZ6YnaeiYrGwecWoqWaZXaG2t7XNoGShoaNitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXqissWaoKtlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-david-beador-do-for-a-living-his-girlfriend-affair-net-worth.html&text=What%20does%20David%20Beador%20do%20for%20a%20living%3fHis%20girlfriend%2c%20affair%2c%20net%20worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-david-beador-do-for-a-living-his-girlfriend-affair-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-david-beador-do-for-a-living-his-girlfriend-affair-net-worth.html&title=What%20does%20David%20Beador%20do%20for%20a%20living%3fHis%20girlfriend%2c%20affair%2c%20net%20worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-does-david-beador-do-for-a-living-his-girlfriend-affair-net-worth.html&title=What%20does%20David%20Beador%20do%20for%20a%20living%3fHis%20girlfriend%2c%20affair%2c%20net%20worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-david-beador-do-for-a-living-his-girlfriend-affair-net-worth.html&title=What%20does%20David%20Beador%20do%20for%20a%20living%3fHis%20girlfriend%2c%20affair%2c%20net%20worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-david-beador-do-for-a-living-his-girlfriend-affair-net-worth.html&description=What%20does%20David%20Beador%20do%20for%20a%20living%3fHis%20girlfriend%2c%20affair%2c%20net%20worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-weeknd-face.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened to The Weeknd's Face?
