Kami Miner is one of the former athlete’s two children with his wife. Miner, dubbed “Baby Jordan,” was one of the most promising University of Southern California grads.</strong></p><p>Miner, on the other hand, resigned from basketball due to injuries and bad form. Years later, his daughter, Kami Miner, has established herself as a promising volleyball player. Harold David Miner (born May 5, 1971) is a former professional basketball player and two-time NBA Slam Dunk Contest champion.</p><p>Miner began his career at Inglewood High School. He was noted for his tremendous dunking skills as well as his active teamwork. His talent at creating stunning dunks earned him the nickname “Baby Jordan.” In his final year, Miner averaged 28 points per game and once had 48 points and 17 rebounds in a single game.</p><p>After graduating from college in 1991-92, Miner was picked by the Miami Heat as the 12th overall pick in the 1992 NBA Draft. Miner retired from the NBA on February 20, 1996, following brief stints with the Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Toronto Raptors.</p><h2>Wife and Daughter of Harold Miner</h2><p>Harold Miner met his wife during a difficult time in his life. After barely a year of dating, the basketball prodigy had a knee injury, causing the Heat to trade him to the Cavaliers. Pam, his wife, was a godsend, going to Cleveland to support him throughout the treatment.</p><p>She also spent several hours sleeping on a hospital chair as her beloved recovered from his injury. Meanwhile, the injured athlete enjoyed her catfish dinner. Pam brought him tranquility in a frenetic world where everyone expected him to be spectacular and the next “Jordan.”</p><p>Miner claims she didn’t care if he could dunk or shoot threes. Furthermore, he knew she regarded him as a failed genius rather than a lover when she looked at him. As a result, in 1999, he proposed to Pam, and the couple married the following year. Miner soon bought a house in Las Vegas and moved in with his wedded wife.</p><p>Miner struggled to quit basketball, and his move to Vegas was an attempt to get away from his past. Pam could detect a troubled husband despite his efforts to filter off his basketball memories. However, Miner was welcomed with good news in 2003: the birth of his first child, a daughter called Kami. This allowed him to rebuild his life and establish a new purpose.</p><h2>Kami Miner is a Protégé</h2><p>Kami Miner strives to win every volleyball competition she enters, and she is glad to have a father who understands the ups and downs of athletic life. Indeed, Kami was a blessing in disguise for Miner. Finally, he could put his employment woes aside and devote all of his energies to assisting his daughter in winning.</p><p>She told ESPN, “It was therapeutic for me to be able to use all that stuff and just pour it into my daughter.” Miner also ensures that his daughter learns broader life skills such as managing expectations, caring for one’s body, and charting one’s own course. As a result, Kami has inherited this, as seen by her tactics, mental toughness, and skills.</p><p>She understands that there is more to life than individual sporting achievements. This, however, does not hinder her from producing results. The 21-year-old was selected Pac-12 Freshman of the Year in 2021. She was voted first-team All-American and Pac-12 Setter of the Year as a sophomore.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Basketball Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Bobby Coon | 40 Arrested For Shooting Death</a></h3>According to reports from the Gallia County Sheriff's Department, the shooting killing of a family by Bobby Coon has terrified the internet users in Ohio.
