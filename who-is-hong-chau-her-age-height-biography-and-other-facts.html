People involved in the migration were called Vietnamese boat people.&nbsp;Among them in 1979 was Hong’s mother, then six months pregnant with the actress whom she later gave birth to in a refugee camp in Thailand.</span></p><p><span>Along with two other siblings, she was raised in New Orleans, courtesy of a family of Vietnamese sponsors who weren’t even related to her.&nbsp;The family was able to find the sponsors with the help of the Vietnamese Catholic Church in New Orleans and kept them for a year or two before they could find footing.</span></p><p><span>So that her parents could see her and siblings at school, they did menial jobs, including cleaning toilets and washing dishes.&nbsp;She was educated at Eleanor McMain High School and then Ben Franklin High School before graduating from the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts.&nbsp;From here she moved to Boston University where she started studying creative writing before switching to filmmaking because her parents needed her to study something more practical.</span></p><p><span>After graduation, Hong Chau got a job with PBS.&nbsp;She wanted to stay in the background by making documentaries because she is introverted.&nbsp;After some time, she moved to New York where she studied acting.</span></p><p><span>In 2008, she had a role on&nbsp;</span><span>The Sarah Silverman</span><span>&nbsp;Asian Masseuse Program, but it was in 2010 that her career took off with TV series like&nbsp;</span><span>How I Met Your Mother</span><span>&nbsp;in which she starred in the episode “Perfect Week”,&nbsp;</span><span>The Trenches</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>NCIS,&nbsp;</span><span>My Boys</span><span>, and&nbsp;</span><span>$h*!&nbsp;My dad says</span><span>.&nbsp;She continued with other works such as&nbsp;</span><span>Treme</span><span>&nbsp;(2011 to 2013),&nbsp;</span><span>From A to Z</span><span>&nbsp;(2014 to 2015), and&nbsp;</span><span>Big Little Lies</span><span>&nbsp;(2017) among others.</span></p><p><span>The first film she participated in was&nbsp;</span><span>Inherent Vice</span><span>&nbsp;in 2014. In 2017, she played the role of Ngoc Lan Tran, a Vietnamese political activist who was imprisoned and then lost his leg in the film,&nbsp;</span><span>Downsizing.&nbsp;</span><span>His portrayal of the character earned him a lot of praise.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>Beautiful woman, Hong Chau is not the greatest actress you will see on screen.&nbsp;Although she looks a bit tall at times, she only stands 5 feet tall.</span></p><h2><strong><span>other facts</span></strong></h2><p><strong><span>1.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Growing up, she never considered becoming an actress, because she thought for someone like her, it was almost impossible.</span></p><p><strong><span>2.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;As a child, Hong Chau was very shy and because of this, she decided to take public speaking lessons, something that could help bring her out of her shell.&nbsp;To improve her confidence, she began auditioning, which she described as her own version of Fear Factor and not just out of acting interest.&nbsp;However, she got good feedback and she enjoyed it.</span></p><p><strong><span>3.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Inasmuch as it was in the United States that she was brought up high, the cultured New Orleans actress is still very good with her Vietnamese.&nbsp;In fact, she grew up speaking the language and only learned English when she was in school.&nbsp;She revealed that she was very grateful to her parents for still speaking Vietnamese with her.</span></p><p><strong><span>4.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;For her role in Inherent Vice, Hong Chau was honored with the Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award for Downsizing, she received a Virtuosos Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, and several other Best Actress awards, including Critics’ Choice Movie Award, the Screen Actors Guild Award, and the St. Louis Gateway Critics Association.&nbsp;Price.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMoaann12YtaLBjKGcq2WRnLJutMSinqGsXZe2sLPRmqehsV2Wu6V5zq2fnqpdm66kwNJo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-hong-chau-her-age-height-biography-and-other-facts.html&text=Who%20is%20Hong%20Chau%3fHer%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Biography%20and%20Other%20Facts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-hong-chau-her-age-height-biography-and-other-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-hong-chau-her-age-height-biography-and-other-facts.html&title=Who%20is%20Hong%20Chau%3fHer%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Biography%20and%20Other%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-hong-chau-her-age-height-biography-and-other-facts.html&title=Who%20is%20Hong%20Chau%3fHer%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Biography%20and%20Other%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-hong-chau-her-age-height-biography-and-other-facts.html&title=Who%20is%20Hong%20Chau%3fHer%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Biography%20and%20Other%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-hong-chau-her-age-height-biography-and-other-facts.html&description=Who%20is%20Hong%20Chau%3fHer%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Biography%20and%20Other%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./isaac-galandauer-md.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dr. Isaac Galandauer, MD  Florham Park, NJ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pioladitingancia-abreu-sosa-bio-age-wiki-medical-condition.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pioladitingancia (Abreu Sosa)  Biography, Age, Medical Condition">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
