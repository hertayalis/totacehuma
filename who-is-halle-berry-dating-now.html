Even though she wasn't looking for one, though, it appears she may have found her life partner.</p><p>After months of teasing her Instagram followers about a new romance, Halle finally clarified that she's dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Van Hunt</a> on social media. And with her recent statements about her new beau, it appears that he may be sticking around for the long haul. Here's the 4-1-1.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Halle Berry proved she’s all in with Van Hunt on Instagram when they started dating.</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight,</a> Halle is completely smitten with Van. In an interview with the outlet, the actress gushed about her main squeeze and called him "the right one."</p><p>“It was finally my time and the right one finally showed up,” Halle said. So cute!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>In case you've been out of the loop, Halle first confirmed her romance with Van in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a September 2020 Instagram post</a> of herself wearing a black T-shirt with the logo of singer Van Hunt. In the caption, Halle wrote, "Now ya know," along with heart and foot emojis.</p><p>The foot emoji was a reference to several previous photos that Halle has posted on her Instagram. The first came in July when she posted a photo of two pairs of feet cuddling up with one another. A month later, the actress posted another photo along the same lines.</p><p>At the time, it was unclear to whom the other pair of feet belonged. Halle later posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptic image of them together</a> that seems to clarify that the other feet belong to Van.</p><p>Halle’s social media reveal came months after Van teased the relationship first. In August 2020, Van posted several photos of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">himself looking into the camera </a>as a woman who appeared to be Halle kissed his cheek. Since then, the couple has been posting adorable photos of one another on their respective Instagram pages.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>now ya know... ♥️🦶🏽</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Halle Berry</a> (@halleberry) on Sep 17, 2020 at 12:04pm PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Van Hunt?</h2><p>Now that Halle and Van are apparently dating, many fans of the actress want to know more about her new partner. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Van</a> has been active in the music world since his self-titled debut in 2004, and he's also won a Grammy. Although he's not an A-list act, Van has carved out a successful career for himself as an R&B musician who draws from a wide array of influences.&nbsp;</p><p>Van has also been pretty vocal about his feelings for Halle. In a March 2021 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, Van explained how much Halle inspires him and has been such a positive influence in his life as a muse.</p><p>"The inspiration for our relationship goes across everything, even in my parenting," Van said. "I'm a completely different person, I can say it like that, and I think that it's improved every aspect of my life."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by van hunt (@vanhunt)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Halle Berry married to Van Hunt?</h2><p>Although she told Lena Waithe during an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>April 2020 conversation</strong></a> that she wasn’t looking for a romantic partner, Van has certainly changed Halle’s mind. Not only did he win her heart, but she says he also gets along great with her two children — Nahla, 14, and Maceo, 8.</p><p>While appearing on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Live With Kelly and Ryan</a> in Nov. 2021, Halle discussed how important it was for her kids to enjoy spending time with Van. In the interview, she says Maceo gave the couple his blessing to get married as they were in the car. However, Halle confirmed that she and Van weren’t married yet.</p><p>“It was a ceremony by an 8-year-old in the back seat of the car who said, ‘Mom, you should get married to him,’” she recalls. “And I said, ‘Really, I should marry him?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, I pronounce you man and wife.’ We were like, ‘Oh, OK. We’re married.’ But we’re not married. So, that’s our commitment ceremony.”</p><p>“I have decided to take time," she continued. "I’m very much a relationship-oriented person, I always want to be with someone. But I decided, no I’m going to slow my roll, I’m going to take a minute and I’m going to spend time with me.”</p><p>Now, Halle is in a good space with a great man who adores her.</p><p>Several months later, Halle and Van became the subject of marriage rumors once again. On New Years' Day 2022, the actress posted a photo of them kissing in a private location during their vacation. Halle captioned the adorable post with “it’s official,” prompting many fans to believe she and Van got married.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Halle Berry (@halleberry)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>However, other commenters noticed her second slide that read “it’s 2022,” making it clear they were celebrating the new year and not a wedding.</p><p>Nonetheless, Halle is in a good space with a great man who adores her, and we’re sure she and Van will get married when the time is right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKGZnKGybq7Eq6myZZSWwaq6xmalqK8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-halle-berry-dating-now.html&text=Halle%20Berry%20Confirms%20That%20Her%20Boyfriend%2c%20Singer%20Van%20Hunt%2c%20Is%20%26quot%3bthe%20Right%20One%26quot%3b&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-halle-berry-dating-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-halle-berry-dating-now.html&title=Halle%20Berry%20Confirms%20That%20Her%20Boyfriend%2c%20Singer%20Van%20Hunt%2c%20Is%20%26quot%3bthe%20Right%20One%26quot%3b" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-halle-berry-dating-now.html&title=Halle%20Berry%20Confirms%20That%20Her%20Boyfriend%2c%20Singer%20Van%20Hunt%2c%20Is%20%26quot%3bthe%20Right%20One%26quot%3b" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-halle-berry-dating-now.html&title=Halle%20Berry%20Confirms%20That%20Her%20Boyfriend%2c%20Singer%20Van%20Hunt%2c%20Is%20%26quot%3bthe%20Right%20One%26quot%3b" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-halle-berry-dating-now.html&description=Halle%20Berry%20Confirms%20That%20Her%20Boyfriend%2c%20Singer%20Van%20Hunt%2c%20Is%20%26quot%3bthe%20Right%20One%26quot%3b" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kiki-vhyce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kiki Vhyce">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ginny-and-georgia-sara-waisglass-plays-maxine-baker.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ginny and Georgia: Sara Waisglass plays Maxine Baker">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
