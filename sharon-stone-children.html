Sharon’s father worked as a factory worker, and her mother was an accountant.</p><p>Stone attended Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, where she studied creative writing and fine arts. She moved to New York City in the early 1980s to pursue a modeling career, and she quickly found success. She appeared in several print and television ads, and she landed a small role in the Woody Allen film “Stardust Memories.”</p><p>In 1984, Stone made her film debut in “Irreconcilable Differences,” which starred Ryan O’Neal and Shelley Long. She went on to appear in several films over the next few years, including “King Solomon’s Mines,” “Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold,” and “Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol.”</p><p>However, it was her role as Catherine Tramell in the 1992 film “Basic Instinct” that catapulted Stone to international fame. The film was a box office success and made Stone a sex symbol overnight. Her performance earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.</p><p>Stone continued to work steadily throughout the 1990s, appearing in films such as “Sliver,” “The Specialist,” and “Casino.” She won a Golden Globe award for her role in “Casino,” and she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.</p><p>In addition to her acting career, Stone has been involved in various humanitarian causes. She is a supporter of AIDS research and has worked with organizations such as amfAR (The Foundation for AIDS Research). She has also been a vocal advocate for breast cancer awareness.</p><p>In 2001, Stone suffered a stroke, which caused her to take a break from acting. She made a full recovery and returned to work in 2003. She has continued to appear in films and television shows, including “Bobby,” “Law & Order: SVU,” and “The Laundromat.”</p><p>In recent years, Stone has expanded her career to include producing. She produced the 2004 film “The Mudge Boy” and the 2010 documentary “My Own Worst Enemy.” She also served as an executive producer on the 2018 series “Mosaic.”</p><p>Stone has been married twice, first to television producer Michael Greenburg from 1984 to 1990 and then to newspaper editor Phil Bronstein from 1998 to 2004. She has three adopted sons: Roan, Laird, and Quinn.</p><p>Throughout her career, Stone has been recognized for her talent and beauty. In 1995, she was named one of People magazine’s “50 Most Beautiful People.” In 2005, she was named one of Empire magazine’s “100 Sexiest Stars in Film History.”</p><p>In addition to her acting and humanitarian work, Stone is also an author. She published her memoir, “The Beauty of Living Twice,” in 2021. The book explores her personal and professional life and the lessons she has learned along the way.</p><p>In conclusion, Sharon Stone has had a long and successful career in the entertainment industry.
