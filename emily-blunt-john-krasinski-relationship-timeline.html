As I shook her hand, I went, 'I like you.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2018, Blunt said that her reaction wasn't all that different.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We were discussing how much I was enjoying being single.

"Then, I think people weren't really sure what was going on, but they were crying because we were crying. But it was great. At the end of the day, she said yes, which is great.

"I look at the pictures and it just has an orange hue that is unnatural to normal skin color. Why was I on a budget on my wedding day? It was a bit patchy. It stinks! And it was a very hot day, so if you sweat and you have a spray tan — wearing white. Just seeping orange.
