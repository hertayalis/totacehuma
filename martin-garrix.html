He had his beginnings with the songs "BFAM," a collaboration with Dutch DJ <a href=#>Julian Jordan</a>, and "Just Some Loops," a collaboration with TV Noise. In the documentary What We Started, Garrix describes how he was discovered by the Dutch record label Spinnin' Records following the release of his remix for the Enrique Iglesias single "Tonight (I'm Loving You)." He signed with Spinnin' Records in 2012, releasing "Error 404," a collaboration with Dutch DJ <a href=#>Jay Hardway</a>. In 2013, Garrix co-released "Torrent" with Dutch DJ <a href=#>Sidney Samson</a> on Tiësto's Musical Freedom label.</p><p>In 2004, he expressed interest in becoming a DJ after seeing Dutch DJ Tiësto perform at that year's Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony in Athens. He took particular inspiration from the track "Traffic," prompting him to download the specialist software FL Studio, and enabling him to start composing.</p><p>Garrix was born as Martijn Gerard Garritsen on 14 May 1996 in Amstelveen in the Netherlands, the son of Gerard and Karin Garritsen. He has a younger sister named Laura. He showed musical interest at an early age and learned to play the guitar at the age of 8.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfoq6zwMinZKCZoqe2uQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmartin-garrix.html&text=Martin%20Garrix%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmartin-garrix.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmartin-garrix.html&title=Martin%20Garrix%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmartin-garrix.html&title=Martin%20Garrix%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmartin-garrix.html&title=Martin%20Garrix%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmartin-garrix.html&description=Martin%20Garrix%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./moose-ali-khan-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Moose Ali Khan Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mark-andrews-injury-whats-the-current-situation-with-mark-andrews.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mark Andrews' Injury: What's the Current Situation with Mark Andrews? - SarkariResult">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
